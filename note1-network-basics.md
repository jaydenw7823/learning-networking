# Note 1: What is a Network?

I am starting completely fresh, so this is what I learned today:

- A network is a group of devices connected together to share information.
- My home Wi-Fi is a type of network.
- Devices like phones, computers, and smart TVs all connect to the router to access the internet.
- I don’t fully understand how data moves yet, but I plan to learn more about routers and IP addresses next.

Reflection: Writing this down helps me understand the basics before trying experiments.
