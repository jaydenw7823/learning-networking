# Learning Networking

I am a high school junior starting fresh with IT and networking.  
I don’t have any experience yet, but I want to learn how networks work, how computers connect, and how the internet works.  

This repo is my notebook where I will:

- Write down what I learn
- Experiment with simple things at home
- Reflect on what I understand and what I find confusing
